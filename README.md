## Purpose of Strapi

Strapi is an open-source, headless Content Management System (CMS) that enables developers and content teams to create, manage, and distribute content efficiently across various platforms and devices. Its primary purposes include:

1. **Content Management Flexibility**: Strapi separates the back-end from the front-end, allowing content creators to manage their content independently. This headless approach enables developers to use any front-end framework or technology while centralizing content management within Strapi.

2. **API-Centric Development**: Strapi helps developers build robust APIs quickly and efficiently. It automatically generates RESTful or GraphQL APIs based on the content types defined through its intuitive admin panel, simplifying the development process.

3. **Customization and Extensibility**: With Strapi, developers have full control over their APIs and content management workflows. It is highly customizable, supporting modifications at every level—from content types and roles to plugins and integrations—making it suitable for a wide range of use cases.

4. **Self-Hosted Solution**: Unlike many CMS solutions, Strapi is self-hosted, giving teams full ownership and control over their data and server environments. This is especially beneficial for organizations with specific security and compliance requirements.

5. **Community-Driven and Open Source**: Strapi is an open-source project actively maintained by a global community of developers. This ensures continuous improvement, a wide range of plugins, and robust support for new features and technologies.
